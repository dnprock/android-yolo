# TensorFlow Android Detect Demo

This folder contains an example application utilizing TensorFlow for Android
devices.

## Description

1. [TF Detect](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/examples/android/src/org/tensorflow/demo/DetectorActivity.java):
        Demonstrates an SSD-Mobilenet model trained using the
        [Tensorflow Object Detection API](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/research/object_detection/)
        introduced in [Speed/accuracy trade-offs for modern convolutional object detectors](https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.10012) to
        localize and track objects (from 80 categories) in the camera preview
        in real-time.
